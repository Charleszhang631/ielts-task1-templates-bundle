# IELTS Task 1 Templates Bundle / 雅思写作 Task 1 模板合集

This repository provides a set of bilingual (English and 中文) templates to help IELTS candidates prepare for Writing Task 1. The templates cover the main visual forms that appear in both the Academic and General Training modules: bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, tables, maps and process diagrams. Each template gives you a structure with sentence starters that you can customise to match the specific question.

## Why use templates?

IELTS Writing Task 1 requires you to produce a concise report based on a visual input. According to IELTS experts, all Task 1 reports follow a similar structure consisting of an introduction, an overview and one or two body paragraphs ([Structure & Paragraphs for IELTS Writing Task 1](https://ieltsliz.com/writing-task-1-paragraphs/#:~:text=In%20writing%20task%201%2C%20you,that%20you%20need%20to%20use)). Having ready‑made sentence patterns helps you focus on describing the main trends and details rather than worrying about how to start each sentence. However, templates should not be memorised word‑for‑word; you should adapt them to the data and use a range of vocabulary and grammar.

Each template contains the following sections:

1. **Introduction** – paraphrases the task statement using synonyms.
2. **Overview** – summarises the most noticeable trends or changes. IELTS guidelines recommend including an overview to satisfy task achievement criteria ([Structure & Paragraphs for IELTS Writing Task 1](https://ieltsliz.com/writing-task-1-paragraphs/#:~:text=In%20writing%20task%201%2C%20you,that%20you%20need%20to%20use)).
3. **Body Paragraph 1** – presents detailed information about the first half of the data.
4. **Body Paragraph 2** – presents detailed information about the remaining data (if necessary).

## Usage

1. Identify the type of visual data (bar, line, pie, table, map or process).
2. Open the corresponding template file in the `templates` directory.
3. Replace the bracketed placeholders (e.g., `X`, `Y`, `year1‑year2`) with the specific details from your question.
4. Adjust the sentence structure and vocabulary to accurately describe the data while maintaining coherence.

## Schedule for first open posting

We plan to publish the first template post on Xiaohongshu as an open post to introduce this bundle and share the bar chart template. The schedule should align with your regular posting cadence. Please let me know your usual posting day and time so that I can set up the post accordingly. If you don’t have a fixed cadence, a reasonable suggestion would be to publish the first post one week from today.
