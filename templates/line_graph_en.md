# Line Graph Template (English)  
This template provides a structure for describing line graph tasks in IELTS Writing Task 1.  

## Introduction  
Paraphrase the task description by stating what the line graph depicts. For example: "The line graph illustrates the changes in X over the period from year1 to year2."  

## Overview  
Summarise the main trends shown in the graph. Note overall increases or decreases, significant peaks or troughs, and any crossing lines.  

## Body Paragraph 1  
Describe the first line or group of lines in detail. Use specific figures and reference the starting and ending points as well as notable fluctuations.  

## Body Paragraph 2  
Discuss the remaining lines or categories, again focusing on significant trends, comparisons and data points. End with a comparative statement if appropriate.  

> *Tip: Use a variety of verbs such as 'rise', 'fall', 'fluctuate', 'remain steady' to describe changes.*
