# Bar Chart Template (English)  
The bar chart template provides structure for describing bar chart tasks in IELTS Writing Task 1.  

## Introduction  
Begin with a sentence that paraphrases the task description. You can mention what the bar chart compares and across what categories or years. For example: "The bar chart compares X across Y over the period from year1 to year2."  

## Overview  
Provide a summary of the most significant trends or patterns shown in the chart. This should highlight the overall increase or decrease, the highest and lowest values or any notable changes. For example: "Overall, category A experienced the highest increase, whereas category B remained relatively stable."  

## Body Paragraph 1  
Describe the first half of the data in detail. You should report specific figures and comparisons, grouping related categories together. Focus on the most significant values and any similarities or differences.  

## Body Paragraph 2  
Describe the remaining data, again using specific figures and making comparisons. Mention any notable trends or anomalies and conclude with a brief observation if necessary.  

> *Tip: Avoid copying language directly from the task statement. Use synonyms and vary your sentence structure to demonstrate lexical resource and grammatical range.*
